//https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/description/

//Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
//
//A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
//
//Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
//
//Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.
//
//
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: s = "the sky is blue"
//Output: "blue is sky the"
//Example 2:
//
//Input: s = "  hello world  "
//Output: "world hello"
//Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
//Example 3:
//
//Input: s = "a good   example"
//Output: "example good a"
//Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
